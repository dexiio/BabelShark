Simple to use framework for converting between java beans and string representations like JSON, XML etc. 

Binary protocols could also be implemented.

Usage:

To set up simple handling of JSON use the singleton BabelShark class:

BabelShark.getInstance().register(new JsonLanguage());

This will register the json language (built-in - using jackson json processor) within babelshark and you can now start
(de)serializing json whereever you might need to like this:

BabelShark bs = BabelShark.getInstance();

List<Boolean> list = bs.read("[true,false]","json",List.class);

and 

String json = bs.writeToString(list,"json");


All protocols / formats use the same simple set of annotations to determine field names and attributes. Meaning you have a
much cleaner control over your beans


To-Do:
- Implement XML language using JAXB
- Implement Hessian language
- Implement serialized Java language
- Implement serialized PHP language
- Implement Spring view and message converter
